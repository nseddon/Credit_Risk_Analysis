# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to determine credit risk for our lending services company.  In order to do this, we employed different techiniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes of data.  Techniques used included:

-  Naive Random Oversampling
-  SMOTE Oversampling
-  Undersampling
-  Combination (SMOTEENN)
-  Balanced Random Forest Classifier
-  Easy Ensemble Classifier
